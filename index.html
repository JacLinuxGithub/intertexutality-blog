                    <p>
                        Firstly, I want to say that Romeo and Juliet surprised me. In a good way I mean. I always thought that it was a cheesy love story that ends with both of them killing themselves. But when I actually read it, I realised that it is much deeper than that. It’s about two people trying to love each other in a world that is completely against them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What stuck out to me most when reading it was how young they are. Romeo and Juliet are just kids trying to survive in a toxic Verona created by everyone. Their parents, their families, even the people they thought were helping, like the Nurse and Friar Laurence. The whole time, these adults are stubbornly making decisions for them instead of actually listening. It was frustrating to read. But then you should also realise that this is around the 1300s. The world would have been completely different. I can’t even imagine how difficult it would be if someone from the 21st century to go all the way back to the 14th and vice versa.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another thing that hit me was the way love and violence were constantly side-by-side. Romeo and Juliet fall for each other in a moment that feels so pure and magical, but the world around them is full of duels, death, and revenge. Romeo kills Tybalt out of grief and revenge for the death of Mercutio. Juliet fakes her death just to escape her parents’ plan of marrying her to Count Paris. That doesn’t sound like romance. Just desperation. Desperation to leave Verona for a peaceful life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But maybe this desperation is the whole point of the story. Shakespeare isn’t trying to write a picture-perfect love story. He’s writing about how messed-up the world can get when people are driven by hate. The feud between the Capulets and the Montagues is basically just a petty drama. No one remembers why they’re fighting, but everyone’s willing to give up their life over it. It’s scary how relevant that is in our world today despite Romeo and Juliet taking place seven centuries ago.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the end, both Romeo and Juliet are dead. Not because their love was flawed – I’m sure they could have lived a great life together – but because of the world around them. Which again, still applies in our world despite the story being set centuries ago. People judge you for the people you love, where you’re from, and how you live. These judgements can destroy something beautiful.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I would say that Romeo and Juliet isn’t just a tragic romance. It’s a powerful look at how love can get crushed under pressure. Not because the feels aren’t real, but because the world around it is messed up. The play does a great job showing how hate, pride, and bad communication can ruin something so beautiful
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Would I pick it up again just for fun? Honestly, probably not. But I totally understand why it’s still such a classic after all these years. If you’re planning to read it, just brace yourself — there’s a ton of chaos and a serious amount of heartbreak ahead.

                    I didn’t expect Edward Scissorhands to be this good! At first glance, it feels like a quirky fantasy — a guy with scissors for hands getting adopted into a pastel suburb. But beneath all this weirdness, it is really a story about being judged, misunderstood, and ultimately rejected for being different from societal norms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What stood out to me when I was watching the movie was how out of place Edward. He walks into a world full of identical pastel-coloured houses and perfect lawns which is the complete opposite of him. He’s quiet, awkward, dressed in black, and has scissors for hands. Instead of trying to understand him, the neighbourhood either feared him or used him. The moment he stops being ‘useful’ or entertaining, they turn on him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It reminded me a lot of how people treat those who don’t fit into what society calls ‘normal,’ whether that’s because of how they look, act, or express themselves. Edward did not mean to be dangerous, but people assume he is. He creates really beautiful things (hedge sculptures, hairstyles, ice art) despite this, he can’t truly connect with anyone because of something he can’t control. That’s what made it so sad to watch. It’s not just that he’s lonely — it’s that the world makes him lonely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can really relate to this. My younger brother has cochlear implants, and we get a lot of weird looks when me and him are out doing errands. He’s only 11 years old, and he didn’t choose any of it — he’s just trying to be like any other kid. But he often can’t. I see him playing by himself in the cul-de-sac or at a nearby playground, and it hurts. I try to play with him when I can, but sometimes I’m busy with other things, and I feel guilty about that. He’s been subject to bullying too, even if he doesn’t always admit it. Watching Edward go through something similar hit really close to home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Edward’s relationship with Kim is where the movie gets even more emotional. She’s the only one who truly sees him for who he is. The snow scene, where she dances as he carves ice, felt like the one moment Edward was able to create something beautiful and share it with someone he cared about. But even that doesn’t last.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the end, Edward has to go back to living in isolation because the world decides he doesn’t belong. It’s not fair — but that’s kind of the point. Edward Scissorhands isn’t meant to be a happy-ending story. It’s a reminder of how people can turn something different into something scary, and how easy it is for someone kind to be pushed out just for not fitting in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a movie, I really liked it. It’s emotional without being overly dramatic, and the visuals — especially the contrast between the mansion and the suburb — make the message even stronger. If you’ve ever felt too weird, too quiet, or too “not normal,” you’ll definitely relate to Edward. In my honest opinion, Edward deserved better.
                </p>
