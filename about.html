                <p>
                    Hello! I'm Jacques Jacob. I'm not a literary expert or anything â€“ just someone who enjoys reading every once in a while, (more like once in a year ðŸ˜­.) Even though I don't read I love using my imagination. That's the only thing keeping me sane during the hour-long commute home from school when I don't have music. It also keeps me sane when I'm done a test early but then I have to wait for others to finishðŸ’”. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My imagination goes everywhere â€“ from realistic stuff that could totally happen in my everyday life to absolutely impossible fantasy worlds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This blog is meant for my ELA Intertextuality assignment. I coded the whole thing by myself using HTML, CSS, and very basic JavaScript with the help of countless forums, subreddits, and documentations. Iâ€™m going to be so happy to close all the tabs after I hand this in!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thanks for visiting! Feel free to hang out, read, and leave your thoughts too (once the commetns actually work)!!
